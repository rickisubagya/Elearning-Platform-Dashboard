# Project Description

365 Data Science is an online learning platform specializing in data science courses. Students learn by watching video content and then evaluate their knowledge by taking quizzes, practice exams, course exams, and career track exams. The exams can be attempted more than once.

This project is to analyze a database, which shows student engagement with the 365 platforms and identify key areas of improvement. I use MySQL to prepare the data and tableau to visualize it.

# Data Preparation
### Source 1
I construct a data source excuted on MySQL environmnent. [Source 1](https://github.com/rickisubagya/Elearning-Platform-Dashboard/blob/main/data_preparation/source_1.sql), which will later form on Tableau:
- Registered Student (Card)
- % Onboarded Student (Card)
- Registered Student (Area)
- % Onboarded Student (Stacked Bar)

### Source 2
I construct a data source excuted on MySQL environmnent. [Source 2](https://github.com/rickisubagya/Elearning-Platform-Dashboard/blob/main/data_preparation/source_2.sql), which will later form on Tableau:
- Total Minutes Watched (Card)
- Average Minutes Watched (Card)
- Top Country by Number of Students Watched (Bar)
- Average Minutes of Top Country by Number Students (Bar)
- Start Date - End Date (Parameter Filter)
- User Type (Parameter Filter)
- Subscription Type (Parameter Filter)

### Source 3
I construct a data source excuted on MySQL environmnent. [Source 3](https://github.com/rickisubagya/Elearning-Platform-Dashboard/blob/main/data_preparation/source_3.sql), which will later form on Tableau:
- Top 5 Course by Total Minutes Watched (Bar)
- Average Minutes of Top 5 Course by Total Minutes Watched (Bar)
- Number Ratings of Top 5 Course by Total Minutes Watched (Bar)
- Average Ratings of Top 5 Course by Total Minutes Watched (Bar)
